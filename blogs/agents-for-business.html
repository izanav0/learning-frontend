agentic future

Just like how every brand, every business has a logo,

The future is where every brand and every business will have their own agent.

Does it have to be a super complex, high-end one?

No, just like how logos can be made with Canva, most agents will be small-scale, but they will be particular to one business/brand.

It will also be a way to differentiate in a saturated market.

AI agent-forward companies will take in more mindshare in the market.

Since agents can be fine-tuned and programmed, they will be much more than a logo; their unique system trait will differentiate one dull agent with one thatâ€™s the face of the brand.

Chatting, texting has become a major thing; ChatGPT has already bought hundreds and millions of people to just talk to a computer.

While the UX maturity is still a long way to go, we are already watching agents take over.

Cobots from mainframes have caught my eye and are taking the lead.

The future is at the horizon, and those who are ready will take the market.
